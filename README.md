A Convolutional Neural Network is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other.

The role of the Cnn is to reduce the images into a form which is easier to process, without losing features which are critical for getting a good prediction.
